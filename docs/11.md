ElevenLabs Launches "Eleven Music," an AI-Powered Music Generation Platform

London & New York – August 5, 2025 – ElevenLabs, a leader in AI audio technology, has officially launched its new platform, "Eleven Music."[1][2] This expansion into music generation allows users to create studio-quality music using natural language prompts.[1][2] The service is designed for a wide range of users, including businesses, creators, artists, and the general public, and can be integrated into ElevenLabs' broader conversational AI products.[3]

Key Features of Eleven Music:

Text-to-Music Generation: Users can generate complete, context-aware songs by describing the desired genre, style, mood, and instrumentation in a text prompt.[4][5][6] The model understands both natural language and musical terminology.[5]

Vocal and Instrumental Tracks: The platform can create music with or without vocals.[6][7]

Multilingual Capabilities: Eleven Music supports the creation of songs in numerous languages, including English, Spanish, German, and Japanese.[5][6][7]

Customization and Control: Users have complete control over the genre, style, and structure of the generated music.[5][6] It's also possible to edit the sound and lyrics of individual sections or the entire song.[5][6]

High-Quality Audio: The generated music is of professional-grade quality (44.1kHz, 128-192kbps MP3), with support for other audio formats planned for the future.[5]

Song Duration: Generated tracks can have a minimum duration of 10 seconds and a maximum of 5 minutes.[5]

A Focus on Legal and Ethical Use

A significant aspect of Eleven Music's launch is its proactive approach to licensing and copyright.[3] ElevenLabs has forged partnerships with major independent music rights organizations, including Merlin Network and Kobalt Music Group.[7][8] These agreements ensure that the music generated on the platform uses licensed data and that rights holders are compensated.[3] This strategy sets Eleven Music apart from competitors like Suno and Udio, which have faced lawsuits over alleged copyright infringement in their training data.[3][8]

The platform also includes built-in safeguards and clear user warnings to prevent copyright infringement.[3] The development of Eleven Music was a collaborative effort with artists, labels, and publishers to establish responsible guardrails.[3][7]

Availability and Pricing

Eleven Music is available now on the ElevenLabs website.[5][6] While specific pricing for the music feature hasn't been detailed separately, it is expected to be integrated into ElevenLabs' existing credit-based subscription plans.[9] These plans range from a free tier with limited credits to various paid plans for creators and businesses, starting from $5 per month.[9][10][11] For high-volume use cases, such as licensing for film and television, custom enterprise plans are available.[12]

API access for Eleven Music is not yet publicly available but is expected soon, with early access available upon request.[5][6]
